Moved all my svn repositories to git. My private repositories are stored in a folder in google drive. All the public ones are stored in GitHub. The ["Complete Idiot's Guide to git-svn-migration"][svn-git-guide] by John Albin was very helpful. Uploading the .git to GitHub was more of a hassel than expected. I ended up using GitHub Desktop to do it.
